            <p>  Shusha is a city and the centre of the Shusha Districy of Azerbaijan.Situated at an altitude of 1,400–1,800
                metres (4,600–5,900 ft) in the Karabakh mountains, Shusha was a mountain recreation resort in the Soviet
                era.
                <br> According to some sources the town of Shusha was founded in 1752 by Panah Ali Khan.From the
                mid-18th century to 1822 Shusha was the capital of the Karabakh Khanate. The town became one of the
                cultural centers of the South Caucasus after the Russian conquest of the Caucasus region in the first
                half of the 19th century over Qajar Iran.
                <br> Between 1992 and November 2020, Shusha was under the de facto control of the self-proclaimed
                Republic of Artsakh and administerd as part of its Shushi Province. On 8 November 2020, Azerbaijani
                forces retook the city during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War following a four-day long battle.

                cathedral to film the destruction of a previous shelling on the same day.Azerbaijani Ministry of Defence
                has denied the shelling of the cathedral by stating that "destruction of the church in Shusha has
                nothing to do with the activities of the Army of Azerbaijan.The House of Culture was also badly damaged
                in the fighting. <br>
